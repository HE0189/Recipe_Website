        <p>
            When John Chandler 
            submitted this lasagna recipe to Allrecipes more than 
            20 years ago, he had no idea how successful it would
             become. One of our top-performing recipes of all time,
              World's Best Lasagna racks up more than 7 million 
              views per year and has ranked among the most popular
               lasagna recipes on the internet for two decades.
                Unfortunately, John unexpectedly passed away at 
                53 years old â€” read all about his life and legacy
